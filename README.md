# Flashburner (ISO TO USB)

Simple python script to create a bootable usb using an .iso file from your computer. It works on Linux (tested on Xubuntu 18.04) but don't work on OS X

Also you need MS-SYS package if you wanna make NT 6.0 bootsector

Usage: sudo python flashburner.py file.iso /dev/object

Use at your own risk.

Note: now not working :/
